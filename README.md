# ðŸ§  Employee Attrition Prediction

This project predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company using HR analytics data.  
It combines data exploration, feature engineering, and machine learning to generate interpretable insights.

---

## ðŸš€ Objectives
- Analyze factors that contribute to employee attrition  
- Build predictive models to estimate attrition probability  
- Deploy an interactive web app using **Streamlit**

---

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost)
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SHAP (Model Explainability)

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Identify trends and correlations  
2. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Create new features & handle categorical variables  
3. **Model Training** â€“ Compare multiple ML algorithms  
4. **Evaluation & Explainability** â€“ Use SHAP & feature importance  
5. **Deployment** â€“ Build a Streamlit app for predictions
